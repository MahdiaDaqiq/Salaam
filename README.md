# Salaam
Salaam translates to peace. “Salaam” is an app that helps raise awareness about Islamophobia. 
Users share their personal experiences with racism. 
I made Salaam because one day while interviewing some people several said that,
" Islam is a death cult. All they want to do is burn, murder, rape and steal. 
They said the five pillars of Islam is one murder, two theft, three pedophilia, bestiality and lies.", 
and also flashed a gun to me as a proof of freedom in America. I didn't tell them I was Muslim, 
I couldn't defend myself because of the fear and that was when I decided these voices of racism should be heard.
So I made Salaam where these stories can be shared anonymously.
